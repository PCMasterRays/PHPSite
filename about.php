<h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
        Computer Science student Richard Dececio created this top quality website for your
        own intellectual indulgence. Admire the wonderful CSS, freshly stolen from DCD,
        and the amazing filesystem used to create ease of use, and a wonderful structure;
        solely for the purpose of existence. Bravo.
