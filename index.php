<h1>What is computer science?</h1>

    <p>Computer science is a very large subject with lots of applications.
    Computer scientists design new software, solve computing problems and develop different ways to use technology.
    But, whatever they’re doing, all computer scientists rely on ‘computational thinking’.</p>


    <p>Computational thinking involves looking at a problem and working out a way a computer might be able to help you solve it.
    To do this, you need to understand how a computer processes information. You probably use computational thinking already, but don’t realise it.
    If you analyse a problem and plan out the solutions, you are using computational thinking.</p>

    <p>A programmer, coder or software engineer is someone who designs and makes computer programs. They might use one type of computer language or many.
    They use computational thinking all the time. Programmers are logical thinkers and problem-solvers.
    They look at problems and try to come up with different ways of solving them.
    There is often more than one way to solve a problem and coders try to find the most efficient way.
    This could mean finding the solution to the problem which requires the least number of steps.</p>
